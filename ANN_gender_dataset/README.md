## Overview
This README provides a brief introduction and guidance on using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). ANNs are a subset of machine learning models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized into layers, and they are used for various tasks, including classification, regression, and pattern recognition.

In this document, we will cover the following topics:

1. Basic Structure of an ANN
An ANN typically consists of three types of layers:

Input Layer: This layer receives the initial data or features.

Hidden Layer(s): These intermediate layers process the input data using weighted connections and activation functions.

Output Layer: This layer produces the final output or prediction.

Each connection between neurons has a weight associated with it, and each neuron applies an activation function to its weighted input to produce an output.

2. Training an ANN
The training process of an ANN involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Prepare your dataset by normalizing, scaling, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Model Architecture: Define the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the activation functions for each layer. This is typically done using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Loss Function: Choose an appropriate loss function based on the task (e.g., mean squared error for regression, cross-entropy for classification).

Optimizer: Select an optimization algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, Adam) to minimize the loss function.

Training Loop: Iterate over your training dataset, feed it through the network, calculate the loss, and update the weights using backpropagation.


3. Common Libraries for ANN Implementation
Some popular libraries for implementing ANNs are:

 TensorFlow: Developed by Google, TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning library with a large community and extensive documentation.


Keras: Keras is a high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. It offers a user-friendly interface for building and training ANNs.

Here I had done ANN on a dataset called Gender classification.I used Adadelta,Adam,Sgd as optimizer in this work.
