One-hot encoding is the process by which categorical data are converted into numerical data for use in machine learning. Categorical features are turned into binary features that are “one-hot” encoded, meaning that if a feature is represented by that column, it receives a 1 . Otherwise, it receives a 0.

Here OnHotEncoding is done on Titanic dataset.
