### Crab dataset
Principle Component Analysis or PCA is the best known dimensionality reduction algorithm. It combines existing features into fewer ones. Its goals are mainly:

To transform original features "high-performance" ones.

To reduce the data dimensionality until you are left with the most relevant ones.

Remove multicollinearities
PCA is essentially a coordinate transformation where the original axes are features and the new axes (the new coordinate system for the data) are the principal components.

Here, I done PCA on a dataset called Crab.This dataset includes:

Species

Frontal_Lobe

Rear_Width

Carapace_Midline

Maximum_Width
