# Salary Dataset README

## Overview

This README file provides an overview of a dataset named "Salary Dataset" that contains information about individuals' salaries based on their age, gender, education level, job title, years of experience, country, and race. The dataset has been analyzed using various machine learning models for salary prediction.

## Dataset Information

- **Age:** Age of the individual (float64).
- **Gender:** Gender of the individual (object).
- **Education Level:** The education level of the individual (object).
- **Job Title:** The job title of the individual (object).
- **Years of Experience:** The number of years of experience of the individual (float64).
- **Salary:** The salary of the individual (float64).
- **Country:** The country in which the individual resides (object).
- **Race:** The race of the individual (object).

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used for data analysis and machine learning:

- Pandas (pd): Data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy (np): Scientific computing.
- Matplotlib (plt): Data visualization.
- Seaborn (sns): Enhanced data visualization.
- Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library for preprocessing and modeling.
- Warnings: Used to suppress warning messages.
- Pickle: Serialization for model persistence.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. Additionally, the dataset might have been cleaned and outliers handled, but specific details about these processes are not mentioned here.

## Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models were applied to predict salaries based on the dataset. These models include:

- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- AdaBoost Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- Linear Support Vector Regressor (LinearSVR)
- Decision Tree Regressor

## Model Evaluation

To assess the performance of the models, various metrics were used, including:

- R-squared (R2) Score: A measure of how well the model fits the data.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.

## Saving the Model

The trained machine learning model(s) might have been saved using the Pickle library for later use or deployment.

## How to Use

To use the provided analysis and models:

1. Make sure you have the required libraries installed (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn).

2. Load the dataset into your Python environment.

3. Follow the code and examples provided in the analysis scripts to perform your analysis or use the trained models for salary prediction.
