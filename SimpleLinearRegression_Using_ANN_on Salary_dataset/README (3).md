### Overview
In this machine learning project, I aim to leverage Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address a specific problem or achieve a particular objective. ANNs, inspired by the human brain, have proven to be a powerful tool for various tasks, including pattern recognition, regression, and classification. 
This README file provides information about the "Salary_dataset.csv" dataset, which is used in an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) project. The dataset contains information related to salary prediction.
